# Item-Lister

This is a small project that I did while learning about manipulating the DOM (document object model).

The program uses vanilla javascript to add events on different elements retrieved by ID, when the event occurs a 
function is called to manipulate elements of the DOM resulting in a dynamic website. The events are:

- onSubmit : add new item to list after submitting a form containing item details
- onClick : clicking on the delete button of an item will remove the element from dom
- onKeyUp : when typing on a search bar, the list of items will filter out the items that don't include the characters
